## Usage instructions

Boot into the Arch Linux Live environment, and get it online. In the `root@archiso ~ #` prompt, type: _([view source](https://git.io/fhLAB))_

```sh
bash <(curl -sL https://git.io/fhLAB)
```

A more detailed guide is available here: [**Installation guide**](./docs/install_guide.md)

## Limitations

- The installer is best suited for modern desktops. Only GPT disks and UEFI boot are fully-supported. (Legacy MBR setups are okay, too, but you'll have to partition/format/mount it manually.)

- Swap partitions aren't automatically handled. (You can enable automatic swapfile management via systemd-swap, which I personally prefer.)

## Is it safe?

Yes.

- It won't modify anything until the very last step. Feel free to explore it (even on your live system).

- It won't actually partition disks for you (unless you choose `Full wipe`). If you choose to 'partition now', it will simply print instructions on how to use `cfdisk` to do it yourself.

- It tries to exit when it finds that something may not be in order. It even displays helpful troubleshooting messages whenever possible.
